# intelehealth-datateam-intern-scripts


Implemented the analysis pipeline using Streamlit (app.py). This allows a user to upload any CSV/Excel file and automatically generate all the visualizations and statistics (diagnoses counts, single vs multiple diagnoses, images stats, medications, referrals, age and gender stratifications, etc.) through a simple web interface, without having to run the scripts manually for each month.
